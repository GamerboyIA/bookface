  <span class="aboutme1">About me:</span>
  <span class="aboutme2">I am a 3 meter tall solid black being with glowing purple eyes. 
  Many people are extremely confused and intimidated by me the first time they see me, 
  this is primarily because I behave differently from other creatures encountered in my reality. 
  I am passive by nature but I DESPISE making eye contact as it causes me uncontrollable rage.

  <span class="hobbies1">Hobbies:</span>
  <span class="hobbies2">I love collecting blocks from my surroundings I have found that it very deeply upsets 
  players when I take blocks from their buildings but thats just what they get for looking at me without 
  my permission.
