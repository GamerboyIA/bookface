    I am that boss that you usually had no idea existed but managed to spawn by accidentally hitting a random bug
    I am easily the most colorful boss and also the brightest. I am also one of the few bosses that rewards you
    by making my fight harder.

   Insta killing everything in daytime, filling your whole screen with lights, spawning out of
